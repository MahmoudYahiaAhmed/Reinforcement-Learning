# Reinforcement-Learning
There are 4 locations (labeled by different letters), and our job is to pick up  the passenger at one location and drop him off at another. We receive +20  points for a successful drop-off and lose 1 point for every time-step it  takes. There is also a 10 points penalty for illegal pick-up and drop-off  actions
